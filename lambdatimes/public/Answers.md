1. PropTypes are used to filter out unwanted value types from being entered into an object.  For example if you have an object with a key: value where the value is a string, you would set the PropTypes on that attribute so that you can only pass a string to it on state.
2. Life-cycle events are the steps/processes that the vm or computer takes to render the code within react.  They tell you when something will be rendered, when it will mount, and when it will unmount, chronologically.
3. No clue, didn't get to that.
4. CSS, SASS/LESS, and styled components?  Didn't get into that either.
